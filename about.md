Hi, I'm **Luke McElya**. I am a Computer Science student at Ivy Tech and an aspiring Software Engineer.
I love building creative solutions, learning new Frameworks and APIs, and having fun with coding in any way that I can!
This portfolio is a glimpse into my work and projects, which includes a real-time chat application using
Boost.Asio, and a command-line implementation of Canfield Solitaire. Check out my projects and let me know what you think,
or contribue if you would like!
