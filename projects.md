## My Projects

- **[ChatHive](https://github.com/lukemcelya/ChatHive)**  
  ChatHive is a real-time messaging app made in C++ with the help of Boost.Asio.
  At the moment this is executed at the command line and through separate terminals,
  but GUI features and online functionality will be implemented soon!

- **[Canfield Solitaire](https://github.com/lukemcelya/CanfieldSolitaire)**  
  Canfield Solitaire is a difficult, unwinnable version of Solitiare. This recreation
  is displayed in the command line, using arrays of strings to output playing cards, line
  by line. This was one of my favorite programs to develop in school and I am very proud of it.
