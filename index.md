  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Luke McElya. I am a Computer Science student at Ivy Tech and an aspiring Software Engineer.
    I love building creative solutions, learning new Frameworks and APIs, and having fun with coding in any way that I can!
    This portfolio is a glimpse into my work and projects, which includes a real-time chat application using
    Boost.Asio, and a command-line implementation of Canfield Solitaire. Check out my projects and let me know what you think,
    or contribue if you would like!

    </h3>
    <p>
      ChatHive is a real-time messaging app made in C++ with the help of Boost.Asio. At the moment, it runs on the command line (via separate terminals), but GUI features and online functionality will be implemented soon!

    </h3>
    <p>
      Canfield Solitaire is a difficult, unwinnable version of Solitaire. This recreation is displayed in the command line, using arrays of strings to output playing cards line by line. This was one of my favorite programs to develop in school, and Iâ€™m very proud of it!
